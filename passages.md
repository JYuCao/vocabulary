These 4 lessons are for elementary to pre-intermediate level. Free 2-page printable ESL mini-lesson also available.")

The African Union (AU) has called for an end to a widely used map that shrinks the African continent. The map is called the Mercator **projection**. It was created by mapmaker Gerardus Mercator in 1569. In the 18th century, it became the international standard for sailors. It is now the world's most widely used map. However, it does not show the true size of different nations. Countries farther away from the Equator look larger than they really are, whereas countries closer to the Equator appear smaller. The AU is supporting a campaign called Correct the Map. It is also calling for a design that shows the correct size of Africa, and of other continents and countries.

The **deputy** chairperson of the AU spoke about the Mercator map. She told Reuters: "It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not." She said the Mercator gave the impression that Africa was less important. She said Africa is the world's second-largest continent by area and has more than one billion people. The executive director of the non-profit organization Africa No Filter agreed. She said the Mercator map was "the world's longest **misinformation** and **disinformation** campaign and it just simply has to stop". The group Speak Up Africa wants people to use the 2018 Equal Earth map, on which "Africa appears 14 times larger than Greenland, as it actually is".

# 2 [Data centres putting strain on water supplies](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2508/250818-data-centres-water.html "Free 26-page lesson with listenings &amp; 30+ online quizzes on data centres putting a strain on water supplies. These 3 lessons are for intermediate level and above. Free 2-page printable ESL mini-lesson also available.")

The National **Drought** Group (NDG), an environmental organization in the UK, has warned that data centres are putting a strain on the country's water supplies. This is also a concern in many other countries. The group did not **indicate** to what degree these **facilities** are contributing to drought conditions in many parts of the UK. It is estimated that the centres use up to 10 billion **litres** of water per year to cool their giant facilities. One water company reported that a large data centre can use as much water as 50,000 households. Despite concerns from environmentalists, the UK is pushing ahead to build many more data centres. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said they were essential for economic growth.

The NDG has urged Britons to take measures to cut back on their water consumption. One such measure is to **trash unwanted** emails and large images. The group claims this will lessen the demand for water. A government website suggested deleting old emails and pictures "as data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems". NDG chairperson Helen Wakeham said a simple everyday action such as tidying up one's **inbox** and **spam** and trash folders will "really help the **collective** effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife". However, it is likely that the water saved from people deleting files stored in the cloud is *merely a drop in the ocean.*

# 3 Zoo asks for unwanted[ pets](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2508/250811-zoo-pet-food.html#) to feed to big cats

A zoo in Denmark has made an unusual request to pet owners. The Aalborg Zoo in the north of the country has asked people to donate unwanted pets, such as chickens, guinea pigs, rabbits, and small horses. These will not be exhibited as part of the zoo's collection. Instead, they will become food for the **resident** big cats and other **predators**. The zoo is attempting "to imitate the natural food chain of the animals". It added that using the unwanted small creatures as food is practical because "nothing goes to waste, and we ensure the natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators". It **reassured** people that the donated pets will be "gently **euthanized**" before being fed to other animals.

The zoo said that the practice of putting down animals to be used as feed was common in Denmark. Pia Nielsen, deputy director of the zoo, said: "Many of our guests and partners appreciate the opportunity to contribute." Regardless, there has been mixed reaction on social media. Some people felt sad about the euthanasia scheme, and wanted to protest. However, a man who donated a horse to the zoo was satisfied with its treatment. He said his animal was put down "in the most peaceful and calm way". There is so much interest in helping the zoo that there are waiting lists to donate horses. **Donors** can even receive a tax deduction based on the animal's value.

# 4 [Jeans and Genes](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Jeans and Genes: Jeans video sparks race and genetics debate. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

A video from a U.S. fashion **retailer** has created controversy over its use of the words "jeans" (as in denim) and "genes" (as in genetics). Social media is **alight** with claims the video is racist. The company, American Eagle, produced the video for its new line of clothes. The video stars **denim-clad** actress Sydney Sweeney. She tells the camera: "Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour. My jeans are blue." The video closes with the tagline: "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans." American Eagle said the play on words was part of its ad **campaign**'s "**provocative** language". It said the words were definitely going to "push buttons".

Many people have criticized the wordplay for having **eugenic** **undertones**. Eugenics is a **debunked** theory that **posits** that humanity can be improved by encouraging people with certain genes to reproduce, to increase the occurrence of "desirable" racial traits. Critics of the ad highlight the fact that Ms Sweeney is white, blue-eyed, and blonde. They suggest her looks are really "great genes". Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly called the criticism a "leftist **meltdown**". U.S. Vice President JD Vance called it an overreaction. Meanwhile, the White House communications director said attacking the ad was "cancel culture run **amok**". American Eagle says its ad "is and always was about the jeans."

# 5 [Matcha](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Matcha: Matcha in short supply worldwide. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

The popularity of **matcha** is **skyrocketing** worldwide. The famous **finely-ground** green tea **powder** is in short supply. Most of the world's matcha is produced in Japan. Record high temperatures there have lowered harvests of the shade-grown tea leaves. Increased demand and lower crop **yields** have resulted in prices hitting an **all-time** high. Masahiro Yoshida, a sixth-generation farmer from Uji, Kyoto, told the Reuters news agency about his decreased production. He said he was only able to harvest 1.5 tons of tencha tea leaves this year, instead of his typical harvest of two tons. He added: "Last year's summer was so **scorching** that it damaged the bushes, so we couldn't **pluck** as many leaves."

Matcha has exploded in popularity, from being a **niche** product to becoming a trendy flavouring for beverages, **smoothies**, desserts, and even skincare products. The Global Japanese Tea Association said Japan's tourism boom is **exacerbating** the green tea shortage. It told the website Sustainability Magazine: "Many foreigners buy lots of matcha…as souvenirs, sometimes even in bulk." It that added this increased appetite for matcha was "unprecedented," and was in part **fuelled** by social media. Yuki Ishii, founder of the store Tealife, said demand has grown **ten-fold**, and that he is always out of stock. "Matcha **mania**" has resulted in a **scarcity** that is also affecting Japan's traditional tea ceremonies.

# 6 [Voting Age](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Voting Age: U.K. to lower voting age from 18 to 16. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

The British government has announced a lowering of the voting age to 16. This is two years lower than the current age at which a person can cast their vote. This "**seismic**" change is part of a package of reforms that will give the **electoral** system greater **integrity**, while including more young people in the democratic process. The first chance 16- and 17-year-olds will have to exercise their right to vote will be in the UK's next general election. The government said: "We are modernizing our democracy, so that it is fit for the 21st century. By [extending] the vote to younger people, we are taking a generational step forward in restoring public trust and boosting engagement in UK democracy."

There has been mixed reaction in Britain to the change. Supporters contend that 16-year-olds in Britain work and pay taxes, so they should be allowed to vote. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed. He said: "If you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on." The UK's deputy prime minister said: "Young people already contribute to society by working, paying taxes and serving in the military. It's only right they can have a say on the issues that affect them." However, there are many critics. Some point to the fact that 16-year-olds cannot drink alcohol, buy a lottery ticket, or get married without their parents' consent, yet they will be able to vote.

# 7 [De-extinction](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on De-extinction: De-extinction company plans to recreate giant moa bird. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

It may only be a matter of time before dinosaurs are back among us. Biotechnology and genetic engineering company Colossal Biosciences claims it is on the **cusp** of successfully bringing back extinct species. On Tuesday, the company announced its plan to **resurrect** the **moa** – a 3.6-metre-tall, flightless bird. The giant moa once **roamed** New Zealand's South Island. It was hunted to extinction 600 years ago. Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro said: "We're bringing back **avian** dinosaurs." Her colleagues will try to recreate the extinct bird by extracting DNA from the bones of **long-deceased** moa. Scientists will use this DNA to modify the **genome** of an **emu**, which is the closest living relative of the moa.

Colossal is **embarking** on many "de-extinction" projects. These have created controversy among the scientific community. Colossal defines de-extinction as: "The process of generating an organism that both resembles and is genetically similar to an extinct species." It claims de-extinction will allow scientists to engineer natural resistances in endangered animals today. It would also enhance the adaptability of species to "**thrive**" **amid** climate change, **dwindling** resources, disease and human interference. However, critics contend that extinct animals cannot be **replicated**. Many scientists are concerned about the unforeseen and **detrimental** impacts of inserting "hybrid" species into the wild.

# 8 [Cheese &amp; Nightmares](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Cheese &amp; Nightmares: Scientists say cheese could give us nightmares. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

New research suggests that dairy products, cheese in particular, could give people nightmares. Research published in the journal "Frontiers in Psychology" found that people with a severe **lactose** **intolerance** were more **prone** to bad dreams and **insomnia**. Professor Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Dream and Nightmare Lab in Montreal, Canada, analyzed the diet, health and sleep patterns of more than 1,000 people. She wanted to investigate the degree to which food affected dreams. She based her research on a 2015 study that looked into "food-dependent dreaming". Participants in the 2015 study blamed cheese and other dairy products for disturbing their sleep.

Dr St-Onge discovered that people with **gastrointestinal** problems and lactose intolerance had scarier and more frequent nightmares. She said: "If you have gastrointestinal issues, that could **account for** a lot of what's happening **in terms of** sleep disturbances that could be associated with different dreams." Her colleague, Dr Tore Nielsen, said: "Sleep disturbances affect a huge proportion of the general population. One large survey found that 30-40 per cent of individuals will have a **clinically** significant sleep disorder in their lifetime." Previous research suggests that about 85 per cent of adults have a nightmare at least once a year, with about 5 per cent of people experiencing them frequently.

# 9 [School Discipline](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on School Discipline: El Salvador cracks down on discipline in schools. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

El Salvador is **cracking down** on school discipline. President Nayib Bukele has appointed a former army captain, Karla Trigueros, as education minister. She has started inspecting schools wearing army **fatigues**. Ms Trigueros is also a physician and was head of the country's vaccination **logistics** during the coronavirus pandemic. One of her first **edicts** was to require all school principals to become role models. School heads will be required to greet students as they come through the school gates each morning. They will also **scrutinize** pupils' haircuts and uniforms. Trigueros warned schools that: "Failure to comply with these provisions…will be considered a serious breach of administrative responsibility."

The main focus of El Salvador's new education initiative is on appearance and conduct. In particular, boys are required to have **closely-cropped**, military-style haircuts, while all students must wear tidy uniforms and greet all teachers respectfully. There has been mixed reaction to the new policy. A leading teachers' union called it a "regrettable militarization" of schools. It was concerned that the country was **veering** back to the days of military dictatorship. It said: "We are concerned that the already [**endemic**] abuses of power against students will increase." However, many parents are supportive of the new rules. One said: "That's how you straighten children out from a young age."

North Korea will open a beach **resort** on Tuesday to provide a boost to its tourism industry. The Wonsan-Kalma tourist zone is on the east coast. Its **gleaming** new hotels can accommodate 20,000 guests. State media reported that the flagship resort is the first of many developments planned throughout the country. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un cut the **ribbon** at a **lavish** opening ceremony. He called the new destination "the proud first step" toward fulfilling the nation's policy of expanding its travel sector. He added that the resort would "play a leading role in establishing the tourist culture" of North Korea. He also said it was one of the country's "greatest **feats**" of the year.

This new destination is North Korea's latest site for holidaymakers. It will initially **cater** to the domestic market, but officials say it will welcome foreign visitors. The Korean Central News Agency reported that Russian tours will start in late July. A state official stated that there could be an **influx** of Chinese tourists. "We are monitoring the potential resumption of large-scale Chinese group tours to North Korea, but no **concrete** signs have emerged yet." Chinese travellers constituted more than 90 per cent of visitors before the coronavirus pandemic. North Korea hasn't fully lifted a ban on foreign visitors that it **imposed** during COVID-19. It remains unclear when other international guests will be able to visit.

# 11 [Grow a Garden](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Grow a Garden: Grow a Garden game breaks record for concurrent users. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

A game about gardening has broken the record for the most users being online at the same time. The **horticultural-themed** game is called Grow a Garden. It first broke the record for **simultaneous** users on the 14th of June, when there were 16.4 million concurrent users. This surpassed the previous milestone of 14.3 million set by the **blockbuster** game Fortnite. Grow a Garden then **shattered** its own record on the 21st of June, with 21.3 million players. This made it the most‑played video game ever at a single moment. The game is owned by the online game platform Roblox. A spokesperson said the game's "global success is fuelled by exceptional user **retention** and **vibrant** social interactions".

Grow a Garden is a simulation game in which players tend to a patch of bare, virtual land. **Budding** gardeners buy seeds, plant vegetables, and grow flowers and herbs. They then harvest their produce to earn in-game currency and resources. Users can also upgrade their garden to obtain better tools and new areas. Good gardeners can level up to unlock rare seeds, exotic crops, and new **biomes** (like underwater gardens or magical forests). The BBC asked behavioural expert Professor Andrew Przybylski on whether the game could cultivate a love of gardening. He said: "It is unlikely that a game like this will encourage real-world gardening any more than Super Mario encourages **plumbing**."

# 12 [Iran-Israel](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Iran-Israel: Iran and Israel continue to exchange airstrikes. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

The conflict between Israel and Iran is **escalating** as the two nations exchange waves of **ballistic** missile attacks. This latest crisis in the Middle East comes after Israel launched its biggest ever airstrikes against Iran on Friday. It destroyed Iranian military targets and missile launchers. It also killed the head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards, plus senior military figures and nine nuclear scientists. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's operation was to "**thwart** the Islamic regime's nuclear and ballistic missile threat". Israel's military actions came a day after the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran was "in breach of its [nuclear] **non-proliferation** obligations".

Iran's capital city Tehran was bombed for the first time since the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has accused Israel of initiating a war. He said: "Our response will not be **half-hearted**". Iran said Israel would pay a "heavy price" for its attacks. However, the Israeli military reported Iran fired fewer than 100 missiles. It said most of these were either **intercepted** or fell short. Netanyahu has spoken directly to the Iranian people. He told them: "We are clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom. The regime does not know what will hit it. It has never been weaker. This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard."

# 14 [Volcanoes](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Volcanoes: Greener trees may be sign a volcano will erupt. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

Predicting volcanic eruptions is never easy. For centuries, volcanologists and **seismologists** have studied the activity beneath Earth that might indicate an eruption. Forecasting when a volcano might erupt has been somewhat unreliable. However, scientists from NASA and the Smithsonian Institution say they are a step closer to providing more accurate forecasts of when a volcano might blow. NASA used images from space to detect changes in the colour of leaves. The research was based on a 2019 study from McGill University. This study showed that an increase in carbon dioxide levels emitted by two active volcanoes in Costa Rica had an impact on the colour of leaves in the surrounding areas.

Current methods of predicting an imminent volcanic explosion include checking seismic activity, changes in ground height, and carbon dioxide and **sulphur** dioxide emissions. NASA said the new method of monitoring changes in the colour of **foliage** from space could help in foretelling eruptions. The science behind this is fairly straightforward. As **magma** moves upwards through Earth's crust, it releases carbon dioxide. Trees absorb this and their leaves become greener and more vibrant. The LiveScience website said: "These signs can help to protect communities against the worst effects of volcanic blasts, including lava flows, **ejected** rocks, ashfalls, **mudslides**, and toxic gas clouds."

# 15 [Retirement Age](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/ "Graded English news lesson plan on Retirement Age: Denmark to have world's highest retirement age. For ESL, EFL, current events, teaching English.")

Higher rates of **longevity** are pushing up ages of retirement. In line with this, the Danish government has just announced it will raise the retirement age for its citizens from 67 to 70 by the year 2040. In so doing, Denmark's workers will have the world's longest wait before they can retire. Denmark said the new law was necessary to keep pace with increasing life **expectancy**. However, Jesper Rasmussen, a trade union leader in Denmark, expressed his **consternation** at the government's move. He said: "Denmark has a healthy economy and yet the EU's highest retirement age". He added: "A higher retirement age means that [workers will] lose their right to a **dignified** senior life."

There is a precedent for the retirement age being 70. The world's first case was in Germany in 1881. It set the age at 70, before reducing it to 65 in 1916. Many countries followed suit and **incorporated** their own ages for workers to retire with a state pension. The USA first adopted a retirement age in 1935. It was set at 65. The USA Today website reported that in America, the retirement age was also steadily creeping up. It wrote: "The upward trend is slow, but striking. In 1994, the average man worked to age 61, while the typical woman clocked out at 59. Americans are living longer, and working longer." China has also announced an increase, to be **rolled out** over the next 15 years.
